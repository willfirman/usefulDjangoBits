# Useful Django Bits

A collection of code snippets and examples that I've found useful working with Django. This is very much a work in
progress and I have plenty more to add to it.

At some point in the future I intend to make it into an installable Django app and publish on PyPI, but for now it's a
full-blown Django project so to use any of the useful bits, you'll need to copy them into your own source files.

The only files of interest are:
- `useful_django_bits/templatetags/useful_django_tags.py` - a collection of template tags that might be helpful
